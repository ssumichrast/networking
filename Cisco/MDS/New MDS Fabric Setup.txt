# New MDS Fabric Setup

## This setup is for instanciating a brand new MDS fabric.
## While the only command that should be run on the switch desired to be principal is the fcdomain priority command,
## I would recommend running all of the setup on one MDS switch that will be principal first, and then join other 
## switches to the FC domain.

# fcdomain priority - Configures the priority of the switch in a domain. 1 = highest, 255 = lowest, 128 = default
# On Principal switch set the default priority to half the default. Bring the principal switch up first with this
# lower priority. Ensures that any new devices that join will never be able to usurp principal
# On member switches, leave to default (128).
fcdomain priority 64

# Create VSANs
# Different VSANs created for fabric A and B to ensure that even if switches from different fabrics get connected
# they won't attempt any merge operations at all. Delivers guaranteed isolation
## VSAN 1 = Disabled (can't be removed)
## VSAN 11 = Production Fabric A
## VSAN 12 = Production Fabric B
## VSAN 13 = Direct Attached A (e.g.: UCS mini to storage array)
## VSAN 14 = Direct Attached B
